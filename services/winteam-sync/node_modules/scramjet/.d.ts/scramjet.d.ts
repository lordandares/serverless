/**
 * Scramjet main exports expose all the stream classes and a number of methods.
 * 
 * All scramjet streams allow writing, reading or transform modes - currently
 * exclusively (meaning you can't have two at once). Any of the scramjet streams
 * can be constructed with the following options passed to mimic node.js standard streams:
 * 
 * * `async promiseTransform(chunk)` - transform method that resolves with a single output chunk
 * * `async promiseWrite(chunk)` - write method that that resolves when chunk is written
 * * `async promiseRead(count)` - read method that resolves with an array of chunks when called
 * 
 * See {@link https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_api_for_stream_implementers node.js API for stream implementers for details}
 * 
 * The object exposes the following classes:
 * 
 * * `DataStream` {@see DataStream} - the basic object stream of any type
 * * `StringStream` {@see StringStream} - a stream of strings
 * * `BufferStream` {@see BufferStream} - a stream of buffers
 * * `MultiStream` {@see MultiStream} - a group of streams
 * * `NumberStream` {@see NumberStream} - a stream of numbers
 * * `WindowStream` {@see WindowStream} - a stream of windows of objects
 * 
 * The general concept of Scramjet streams is facilitating node's TransformStream mechanism so that you don't need
 * to create a number of streams and create the pipeline, but use the concept of chaining instead. When you call `parse`
 * method for instance, scramjet creates a new stream, pipes it to the callee and forwards errors.
 * 
 * What's worth mentioning - scramjet tries to limit the number of created transform streams and pushes the transforms
 * one after another into the same stream class therefore a code `stream.map(transform1).map(transform2).filter(transform3)`
 * will only operate on a single transform stream that evaluates all three transforms one after another.
